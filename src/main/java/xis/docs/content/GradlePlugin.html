        The XIS Gradle plugin simplifies the integration of XIS into your Gradle-based projects by automating several key tasks.
        It automatically manages version configuration for all XIS dependencies, ensuring consistency across your project.
        One of its core features is enabling HTML template files to be placed alongside Java source files in the same directory structure,
        with the plugin automatically copying them to the resources folder during build. This allows for a transparent one-to-one
        binding between controllers and their templates, making the relationship between code and markup immediately clear.
    </p>
    <p>
        The plugin registers a Gradle task under <code>xis/templates</code> that generates simple HTML skeleton templates
        for all annotated controllers (<code>@Page</code> or <code>@Widget</code>). Future enhancements will include
        generating templates with details from the controller, such as forms with proper field bindings.
    </p>
    <p>
        Additionally, the plugin will register an annotation processor to handle validation tasks for XIS annotations and conventions.
        When using xis-boot, the plugin provides a task under <code>xis/runnableJar</code> that creates a standalone executable JAR file.
    </p>
    <p>
        To enable the XIS plugin in your project, add it to your <code>build.gradle</code> plugins block as shown below.
        Once applied, all the features described above become available automatically:
    </p>
    <pre><code> 
plugins {
    id 'one.xis.plugin' version '${xisVersion}'
}
