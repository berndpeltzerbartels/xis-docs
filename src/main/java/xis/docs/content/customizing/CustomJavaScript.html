    <p>
        Pages and Widgets in XIS cannot include JavaScript files using standard HTML <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> 
        tags directly in templates. This is because XIS is a Single Page Application (SPA) where content is 
        dynamically inserted into the DOM at runtime. Browsers do not execute <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags 
        that are added to the DOM after the initial page load - this is an important browser security feature.
    </p>

    <p>
        To include custom JavaScript in your XIS application, use the META-INF extension mechanism. 
        This is useful for:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Framework extensions and global utilities</li>
        <li>Third-party library integration</li>
        <li>Application-wide event handlers</li>
        <li>Custom Expression Language functions</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Create a file at <code>src/main/resources/META-INF/xis/js/extensions</code> that lists your 
        JavaScript files (one per line):
    </p>

    <pre><code>js/global-utilities.js
js/analytics-tracker.js
js/custom-el-functions.js</code></pre>

    <p>
        Place the referenced JavaScript files in <code>src/main/resources/</code>. These files will be 
        automatically bundled and loaded with the XIS framework at application startup.
    </p>

    <h5>CSS and Other Resources</h5>
    <p>
        Unlike JavaScript, CSS files and other resources can be included directly in templates using 
        standard HTML tags, as they do not have the same browser execution restrictions:
    </p>

    <pre><code>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/custom-styles.css"&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/logo.png" alt="Logo"&gt;</code></pre>

    <div class="tipp">
        <strong>💡 Best Practice</strong><br/>
        Keep your JavaScript files organized in <code>src/main/resources/js/</code> and reference them 
        in the META-INF extensions file. This makes it easy to track what JavaScript is loaded in your 
        application.
