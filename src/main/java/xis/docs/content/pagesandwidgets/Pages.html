    <p>
        Pages are the entry points of your XIS application. They are controllers annotated with <code>@Page</code> 
        that map to specific URLs and render complete HTML pages in response to HTTP requests.
    </p>
    
    <h5>Defining a Page</h5>
    <p>
        A page controller is a Java class annotated with <code>@Page("/path")</code>, where the path parameter 
        specifies the URL at which the page will be accessible. Each page controller has a corresponding HTML 
        template file located in the same package following XIS's convention-based approach.
    </p>
    
    <pre><code>@Page("/hello")
public class HelloPage {
    
    @ModelData
    public String greeting() {
        return "Hello World!";
    }
}</code></pre>

    <p>
        The corresponding <code>HelloPage.html</code> template would be placed in the same package and can 
        access the model data provided by the controller:
    </p>
    
    <pre><code>&lt;xis:template xmlns:xis="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform"&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;${greeting}&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/xis:template&gt;</code></pre>

    <h5>Page Lifecycle</h5>
    <p>
        When a user navigates to a page's URL, XIS processes the request through the following steps:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The <code>ControllerService</code> routes the request to the appropriate page controller</li>
        <li>Controller methods annotated with <code>@ModelData</code> are invoked to provide data</li>
        <li>The HTML template is rendered with the provided model data</li>
        <li>The resulting HTML is sent as the HTTP response</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Page vs Widget</h5>
    <p>
        Unlike widgets, pages are directly accessible via URL and represent complete, standalone views. 
        Pages can embed widgets to compose complex interfaces from reusable components.
    </p>
    
    <div class="warning">
        <strong>Important: JavaScript Inclusion</strong><br/>
        Pages and Widgets in XIS cannot include JavaScript files using standard HTML <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> 
        tags directly in the template. This is because XIS is a Single Page Application (SPA) where content is 
        dynamically inserted into the DOM at runtime. Browsers do not execute <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags 
        that are added to the DOM after the initial page load - this is an important browser security feature, 
        but it requires a different approach for SPAs.
        <br/><br/>
        Instead, XIS uses a convention-based approach where you place a <code>.js</code> file with the same name 
        as your controller in the same package. These files are automatically discovered and included. You can 
        also use the <code>@JavaScriptFile</code> annotation for explicit control. Other resources like CSS can 
        be included directly in the template using standard HTML tags. See the Custom Assets documentation for details.
    </div>
    
    <h5>Deep Linking Support</h5>
    <p>
        XIS pages are inherently deep-link capable - each page is accessible via its unique URL path specified 
        in the <code>@Page</code> annotation. Additionally, widgets embedded in pages can also participate in 
        deep linking by specifying their own <code>url</code>, <code>title</code>, and <code>containerId</code> 
        in the <code>@Widget</code> annotation.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        This enables powerful navigation scenarios where users can bookmark specific widget states within a page, 
        and the application will correctly restore both the page and the widget to the expected state when the 
        URL is accessed.
    </p>
    
    <pre><code>// Page provides the foundation
@Page("/dashboard")
class DashboardPage { }

// Widget adds deep-linkable state
@Widget(id = "Statistics", 
       url = "/dashboard/stats/{period}",
       title = "Statistics")
class StatisticsWidget { }</code></pre>
    
    <p>
