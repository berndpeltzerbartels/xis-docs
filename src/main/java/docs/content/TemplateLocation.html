    <p>
        XIS provides flexible options for organizing your HTML templates. By default, templates are placed alongside 
        their corresponding Java controllers, but you can also choose to keep them in the traditional resources folder 
        if you prefer a more conventional project structure.
    </p>

    <h5>Default: Co-located Templates</h5>
    <p>
        The recommended approach in XIS is to place HTML templates directly next to their controller classes in the 
        same package within <code>src/main/java</code>. The Gradle plugin automatically copies these templates to the 
        resources folder during the build process. This creates a transparent one-to-one relationship between controllers 
        and templates, making it immediately clear which template belongs to which controller.
    </p>
    
    <pre><code>src/main/java/
  com/example/
    MyPage.java
    MyPage.html      // Template next to controller</code></pre>

    <h5>Alternative: Resources Folder</h5>
    <p>
        If you prefer to keep templates in the resources folder following traditional Java project conventions, you have 
        two options. You can mirror the package structure as a folder hierarchy in <code>src/main/resources</code>, or 
        you can use the <code>@HtmlFile</code> annotation to specify a custom template location.
    </p>

    <p>
        When mirroring the package structure:
    </p>
    
    <pre><code>src/main/resources/
  com/example/
    MyPage.html      // Mirrors package structure</code></pre>

    <h5>The @HtmlFile Annotation</h5>
    <p>
        The <code>@HtmlFile</code> annotation gives you complete control over template locations. It supports both 
        absolute and relative paths, and works for templates in both <code>src/main/java</code> and 
        <code>src/main/resources</code>:
    </p>
    
    <pre><code>@Page("/mypage")
@HtmlFile("templates/custom/MyPage.html")
public class MyPage {
    // Controller code
}</code></pre>

    <p>
        Relative paths are resolved from the package directory of the controller class. This flexibility allows you to 
        organize templates in whatever way best suits your project's needs while maintaining the clear connection between 
        controllers and their views.
