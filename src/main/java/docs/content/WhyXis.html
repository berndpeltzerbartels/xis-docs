    <h3>Why XIS?</h3>

    <p>Most Java frameworks are either overly complex or rely heavily on conventions that are difficult to trace and
        debug.
        &#036;&#123;frameworkName} was created as a practical alternative. It focuses on:</p>


    <p>Minimal "magic"
        Communication layer is implicitly managed and must not be manually coded
        Transparent communication between components
        A declarative, annotation-driven model
        Seamless integration with modern microfrontend architectures
        An intuitive API with a low learning curve
        It’s designed to be simple, explicit, and robust—ideal for developers who want to understand, not guess.</p>

    <h5>Core Principles</h5>
    <p> Here are the principles that define XIS:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Simple and Lightweight</strong><br/>
            XIS avoids bloated abstractions and excessive dependencies. Its core is small and focused, so your app stays
            fast
            and maintainable.
        </li>

        <li><strong>Declarative, Annotation-Based Programming</strong><br/>
            Controller logic is expressed through clear, Java-based annotations—no need for XML, YAML, or complex
            runtime
            introspection.
        </li>

        <li><strong> Fully Managed Communication</strong><br/>
            The framework handles data flow between frontend and backend automatically, without requiring REST APIs or
            manual
            wiring.
        </li>
        <li><strong> Single Page Architecture by Default</strong><br/>
            Each page is defined by a controller and a corresponding HTML file. Navigation happens without full reloads,
            enabling SPA-like experiences.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Microfrontend Support</strong><br/>
            XIS is built with vertical modularity in mind. It encourages separation into independently developed,
            testable
            units—perfect for microfrontend projects.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Easy to Test, TDD-Friendly</strong><br/>
            Since controller logic is plain Java, it’s easy to unit test. You can use your favorite testing
            frameworks—no
            custom
            bootstrapping required.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Clear View–Controller Mapping</strong><br/>
            Every HTML file has exactly one Java controller. This 1:1 relationship makes navigation, debugging, and
            reasoning
            about your code effortless.
        </li>
        <li><strong> Intuitive API with Low Learning Curve</strong><br/>
            You don’t need to learn an internal DSL. If you know Java and HTML, you’re ready to use XIS productively.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Easy Interoperability</strong><br/>
            XIS plays well with Spring, Micronaut, and other Java stacks. It doesn't lock you in—and can run standalone
            or
            embedded.
        </li>
        <li><strong>No REST, No JavaScript Calls Required</strong><br/>
            XIS eliminates the need to write custom REST endpoints or client-side JavaScript for calling your backend.
            Actions
            are declared once—in the HTML—and automatically linked to your Java controller methods.
            You don’t need to worry about AJAX, fetch calls, or serialization: it all just works.
        </li>
    </ol>
