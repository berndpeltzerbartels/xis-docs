        <strong>Work in Progress:</strong> Distributed application support is currently under development 
        and not yet available in XIS. This feature will allow widgets to be loaded from remote servers, 
        enabling true micro-frontend architectures. This chapter will be completed once the feature is implemented.
    </div>
    
    <p>XIS will support distributed application architectures where widgets can be developed, deployed, and served 
        independently from different servers. This will enable micro-frontend patterns and team autonomy.</p>

    <h5>Planned Features</h5>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Widget Servers:</strong> Deploy widgets independently on separate servers</li>
        <li><strong>Remote Widget Loading:</strong> Load widgets from different origins at runtime</li>
        <li><strong>Cross-Server Communication:</strong> Secure communication between distributed components</li>
        <li><strong>Deployment Patterns:</strong> Best practices for distributed XIS applications</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><em>Detailed documentation will be added once this feature is released.</em></p>
