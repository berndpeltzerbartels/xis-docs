    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
        Before creating &#036;&#123;frameworkName}, I had worked on many web applications and kept noticing the same
        repetitive
        patterns.
        Whether
        in frontend or backend development, I often found myself writing nearly identical code for different
        entities—defining actions, reducers, controllers, and service logic that followed the same structure over and
        over
        again.
    </p>

    <p>
        In the backend, every new feature required a new controller. These controllers usually just wrapped standard
        CRUD
        operations, differing only in the data types they managed. Meanwhile, collaboration between frontend and backend
        teams often led to friction: APIs had to be discussed, documented, implemented, updated—and the cycle repeated
        with
        every change.
    </p>

    <p>
        At the same time, I was fascinated by the idea of microfrontend architecture. It felt like a natural extension
        of
        microservices, enabling a true vertical division of work across teams. But I found few practical implementations
        that made this concept work cleanly in the real world.
    </p>
    <p>
        All of this became the driving force behind &#036;&#123;frameworkName}: a framework that simplifies common
        tasks,
        reduces
        team
        friction,
        and enables clear, scalable frontend-backend structures—without sacrificing control or performance.
